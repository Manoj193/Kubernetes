--------------Going back in time---------------------
Let's take a look at why Kubernetes is so useful by going back in time.
----------------->Traditional deployment era:
In the early days of computing, organizations used physical servers to run their applications. However, managing resources on these servers was a challenge. There was no efficient way to set boundaries for how much computing power, memory, or other resources each application could use on a single server. This lack of control led to problems where one application could consume most of the resources, causing other applications on the same server to perform poorly.
To address this issue, one approach was to allocate a separate physical server for each application. While this ensured that each application had its dedicated resources and wouldn't be impacted by others, it was not a scalable solution. This meant that as the number of applications grew, organizations had to invest in and maintain a large number of individual physical servers. This approach led to underutilization of resources, as many servers operated below their capacity, resulting in increased operational costs for organizations.
In essence, the traditional deployment method of dedicating one physical server per application faced challenges due to inefficient resource management, lack of scalability, and high maintenance costs. This paved the way for the adoption of more efficient and scalable deployment strategies, such as virtualization and containerization, to address these shortcomings in resource allocation.
********************************************************************************************************End of traditional deployment***********************************
----------------->Virtualized deployment era:
To address the challenges of inefficient resource utilization and high maintenance costs in the traditional deployment era, virtualization emerged as a solution. Virtualization enables the running of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. This means that a single server can host several virtualized environments, each acting as an independent instance.
The key advantage of virtualization is the ability to isolate applications within VMs. Each VM operates as if it were an independent machine, running its own set of applications and even its operating system. This isolation provides a level of security, as the data and processes of one application within a VM are shielded from others, enhancing overall system reliability.
Virtualization also facilitates better utilization of resources within a physical server. By allowing multiple VMs to share the same hardware, the server's capacity is maximized, reducing the likelihood of underutilization. This, in turn, leads to improved scalability, as applications can be easily added or updated within their respective VMs without requiring additional physical servers.
Furthermore, virtualization contributes to cost reduction by minimizing the need for a large number of individual physical servers. With VMs, organizations can present a cluster of virtual machines that efficiently utilize the available physical resources. This approach not only optimizes hardware costs but also streamlines the management of applications in a more flexible and dynamic environment.
In essence, virtualization revolutionized the deployment landscape by allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server. This approach enhances resource utilization, scalability, and security, while simultaneously reducing hardware costs and simplifying the management of application environments.
***********************************************************************************************End of Viratualized deployment era***************************************
------------------->Container deployment era:
Containers, like Virtual Machines (VMs), are a technology used to deploy and run applications. However, they differ in their approach. Containers share the same operating system (OS) among applications, making them lightweight and efficient. Each container has its own filesystem, CPU share, memory allocation, and process space. Because containers are independent of the underlying infrastructure, they are highly portable across different cloud platforms and OS distributions.
---------->Containers offer several advantages:
1.Agile Application Creation and Deployment:Containers simplify the creation of application images compared to traditional VMs, making the process more efficient.
2.Continuous Development, Integration, and Deployment:Containers enable reliable and frequent image builds and deployments, allowing for quick and efficient rollbacks due to the immutability of container images.
3.Dev and Ops Separation of Concerns:Application container images are created during build/release time, separating the application from infrastructure concerns during deployment.
4.Observability:Containers not only provide OS-level information and metrics but also offer insights into application health and other signals, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.
5.Environmental Consistency Across Development, Testing, and Production:Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different environments, promoting reliable testing and deployment processes.
6.Cloud and OS Distribution Portability:Containers can run on various operating systems, such as Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, and major public clouds, ensuring flexibility and compatibility.
7.Application-Centric Management:Containers abstract the complexity of running an OS on virtual hardware, allowing a focus on managing applications using logical resources.
8.Loosely Coupled, Distributed, Elastic, Liberated Microservices:Applications are divided into smaller, independent pieces (microservices) that can be dynamically deployed and managed, offering flexibility and scalability.
9.Resource Isolation:Containers provide predictable application performance by isolating resources, ensuring that one container's activities do not impact others.
10.Resource Utilization:Containers achieve high efficiency and density by optimizing resource usage, allowing for more applications to run on the same infrastructure.
In summary, containers offer a lightweight and portable solution for deploying applications. They promote efficiency, agility, and consistency throughout the development, testing, and deployment lifecycle, making them a popular choice for modern application deployment strategies.

In essence, Kubernetes provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing containerized applications but leaves certain choices and configurations to the discretion of users, allowing them to tailor the platform to their specific needs and preferences.
***************************************************************end of what kubernetes not**********************************************************************************
Kubernetes Cluster:---
When you set up Kubernetes, you're essentially creating a cluster. This cluster is composed of two main components: worker nodes and a control plane.

1.Worker Nodes:
--------->Explanation: Worker nodes are the machines in the cluster that carry out the actual work. They run containerized applications, and these applications are organized into units called Pods. Think of worker nodes as the engines powering your applications.

2.Control Plane:
---------->Explanation: The control plane is like the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the worker nodes and oversees the deployment and operation of Pods. In more complex setups, the control plane is distributed across multiple computers to ensure fault-tolerance and high availability. This means that even if one part of the control plane fails, the system remains operational.

3.Minimum Configuration:
----------->Explanation: Every Kubernetes cluster starts with at least one worker node. This single node hosts both the control plane and the application workload. However, in production scenarios, it's common to have multiple worker nodes and a distributed control plane to enhance resilience and handle larger workloads.
In summary, a Kubernetes cluster comprises worker nodes, responsible for running your applications, and a control plane, overseeing the management of these nodes and the deployment of containerized applications. This architecture ensures efficient workload distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability in production environments.
*********************************************end of Kubernetes cluster***********************************************************************************************
----------------->The components of a Kubernetes cluster<--------------------------------
In a Kubernetes cluster, the control plane consists of essential components that manage and make decisions for the entire cluster. These components handle tasks like scheduling applications and responding to events within the cluster, such as starting a new pod when a deployment's desired replicas are not met.

1.Global Decisions:
----------->Explanation: Control plane components are responsible for making significant decisions that affect the entire cluster. For instance, they decide where to deploy applications based on resource availability (scheduling).

2.Detecting and Responding to Events:
------------>Explanation: Control plane components continuously monitor the state of the cluster. When events occur, like a change in the desired number of replicas for a deployment, the control plane responds by taking necessary actions, such as starting additional pods.

3.Component Location:
------------->Explanation: Control plane components can be distributed across different machines in the cluster. However, for simplicity in setup, many configurations run all control plane components on the same machine. It's worth noting that this machine typically doesn't run user containers; its primary role is to manage and control the cluster.
4.High Availability Considerations:
--------------->Explanation: In more complex and production-ready setups, control plane components are often distributed across multiple machines to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. This distributed approach prevents a single point of failure in the control plane.
5.Setup Scripts:
---------------->Explanation: For ease of setup, scripts often configure control plane components to run on a single machine. However, advanced configurations, as outlined in guides like "Creating Highly Available clusters with kubeadm," demonstrate how to distribute the control plane components across multiple machines for increased reliability.
In summary, the control plane components play a crucial role in orchestrating the global decisions and responses within a Kubernetes cluster. They can be deployed on any machine in the cluster, but more sophisticated setups distribute these components across multiple machines to enhance the cluster's resilience and availability.
